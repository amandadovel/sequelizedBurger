Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 
1. Welcome to Bobs Burgers! üòã

    1.1 In the 'Ready to Eat' box on the left side of the page is a list of burgers waiting to be eaten. When the user clicks 'Eat me', the burger will move to the 'Already Eaten' box on the right side of the page.

    1.2 This app stores all burgers in a database and can be deleted using the delete button next to the burgers in the 'Already Eaten' box.

    1.3 At the bottom of the page is an input box where the user can type in a burger of their choice. Once they hit submit, their burger will be moved into the 'Ready to Eat' box on the left side of the page.

2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. The `config` folder holds each of the database objects, one for the deployed app, one for testing and one for JAWSDB which is necessary for the heroku connection.
5. `burgers_controller.js` holds the logic for CRUD. Create, read, update and delete data from the Burger table within the database.
6. The `db` folder holds the table information.
