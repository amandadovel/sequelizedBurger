# Sequelized-Burger üçî
https://pacific-anchorage-71196.herokuapp.com/

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.
Each burger in the waiting area has an 'Eat me' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
This app stores all burgers in a database and can be deleted using the delete button next to the burgers on the right side of the page.


## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 
1. Welcome to Friend Finders!

    1.1. This is the html home page with a button that takes users to survey. 

2. Take survey

    2.1. This page will ask user for name and a link to a photo. Then user will answer 10 questions. After hitting submit, a modal will pop up with their best match. 

## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for grading and testing purposes. 

1. Clone repository. Click on the clone button next to the repository (clone with SSH). 
2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. Inside of the data directory is the `friends.js` file containing the list of ideal matches already stored in the database. 
5. The public directory contains assets, with the html files, the CSS directory with the stylesheet, the images and `app.js` which contains the logic for the submit button on the main page, checks validity of form, and controls the modal.
6. Inside of the routing directory holds the `htmlRoutes` which controls the path to each html page from the browswer. The `apiRoutes` contains the logic for the compatibility check and pushes the results.
7. `server.js` configures the app, requires the dependencies and starts listening on the PORT indicated.
